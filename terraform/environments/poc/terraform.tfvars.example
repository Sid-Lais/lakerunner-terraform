# REQUIRED: Your GCP Project ID
project_id = "your-gcp-project-id-here"

# REQUIRED: GCP Region (choose closest to you)
# Common options: us-central1, us-east1, europe-west1, asia-southeast1

create_vpc = true

# Option 2: Use existing VPC (for customers with network restrictions)

# vpc_name     = "your-existing-vpc-name"
# subnet_name  = "your-existing-subnet-name"

# Compute Options
# Enable a pre-configured VM for testing (optional)
enable_compute = false  # Set to true if you want a ready-to-go processing VM
